## Tests with Jasmine

The boilerplate also encourages you to write tests for your plugin with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

To be able to run the test suite, you'll need to install the Jasmine gem. If you have bundler installed just follow these instructions:

- run `bundle install`
- run `rake jasmine` and go to 'http://localhost:8888/'

### Using Guard Jasmine

Guard automatically tests your Jasmine specs when files are modified which will significantly increase your productivity.

- intall [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) or just run `brew install phantomjs`
- run `guard` from the plugin directory
